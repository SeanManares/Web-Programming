        <p>"All I can say is I needed a Part two of this movie!!!, 
            this movie is amazing I love the way they did the scenes on how the story flows, 
            and how Richard (Finn WittRock) makes the whole movie so presentable, love how he 
            changes every personalities on every scenes, I'm impressed with a little bit of annoyed 
            Haha!, and also (Kelsey Asbille) iris, I'm also impressed by her acting skills, it's such 
            a challenging not to move that for so long and act like a paralyzed woman but she really 
            nailed it!!"</p>
        <p>"A lot of times I can figure out  what's going to happen next or ill predict the ending 
            and I'm usually right but this movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time!!!"</p>
